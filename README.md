# Simple Sadism & Masochism
Requested by [Yuni](http://www.loverslab.com/user/5998-yuni/) and [bathoz](http://www.loverslab.com/user/61250-bathoz/)
 
Note: Latest version probably needs a clean save, if upgrading from 2.x. Or at least a save after uninstalling 2.x
 
Now with NPC support!
 
 
## What does this do?
This mod allows both the player and NPCs to be flagged as Sadists and Masochists, gaining arousal as they deal and take damage respectively. It's very lightweight and shouldn't impact performance at all.
 
 
## Aren't things that apply scripts to people around you terrible for performance?
Yes! If they use a cloak to do so, Simple S&M does not, it instead uses a system to reset a number of quest aliases to fill with actors near the player, this does not cause a large script load or any noticeable performance drops!
 
 
## How does it work?
With the help of a few tricks in papyrus to determine when the player is in combat and to find people near by it simply does some math based on how much damage was done, and then increases the exposure on either the giver or the taker (or both) based on math that is almost entirely configurable by you, the user!
